      <div id = "description">Hi, I'm Lauren! I'm a current senior at UC Berkeley graduating with a degree in Cognitive Science this spring. I've always been intrigued by exploring how people think & perceive, which has sparked my curiosity in psychology, design, and education (and ultimately <a href = "https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/home">cogsci</a>)! I currently work two side hustles in addition to being a full-time student: as a UX researcher conducting user interviews and generating early-stage wireframes for a <a href = "https://qooley.com/">travel startup</a>, and as a research assistant running behavioral studies for a <a href = "https://whitneylab.berkeley.edu/index.html">UC Berkeley cognitive psychology lab</a>. As such, I'm excited to be learning more every day about how to design with humans in mind. <br> <br> My friends know me as a lover of dogs, the Dodgers, and Dodger Dogs. You can catch me on the weekends drinking Vietnamese iced coffee and finding something new to learn (currently: reading <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386580.Survival_in_the_Killing_Fields">this autobiography</a> of Dr. Haing Ngor).</div>
      
      <div id = "conclusion">Read more about my projects <a href = "projects.html">here</a>, and contact me /here/. Cheers!</div>
